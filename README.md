# seniorthesis: Approximating Equilibrium in Extensive Games with Imperfect Recall via Counterfactual Regret Minimization
# By: William Kang

These are implementations for my senior thesis.
Here are the descriptions of what these files are:
1. MCCFR - Implementation of Outcome-Sampling MCCFR for Goofspiel(5)
2. runMCCFR  - Runs MCCFR, cleans up data collected, and tests average strategy against Goofspiel simulation
3. Goofspiel - Goofspiel object that basically runs Goofspiel
4. FinalAlgorithm - Implementation of Average-Outcome-Sampling MCCFR for Goofspiel(5)
5. runAOS - Runs FinalAlgorithm, cleans up data collected, and tests average strategy against Goofspiel simulation

Note: If you download these files and try running them, they should produce identical/simular results as in my thesis Empirical Evaluations chapters! Summarizing data into a table was manually done but all the data necessary for reproducing those tables will be generated from these files!
